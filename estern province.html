            <h3>Trincomalee Fort</h3>
            <p>
              Fort Fredrick also known as Trincomalee Fort or Fort of
              Triquillimale, is a fort built by the Portuguese at Trincomalee,
              Eastern Province, Sri Lanka, completed in 1624 CE, built on Swami
              Rock-Konamamalai from the debris of the world-famous ancient Hindu
              Koneswaram temple (Temple of a Thousand Pillars). The temple was
              destroyed by the Portuguese colonial Constantino de Sá de Noronha
              under Phillip III, the occupier of the Jaffna kingdom and Malabar
              country on the island. On the Konamalai cape was also built a new
              village of Portuguese and Tamil people, 50 Portuguese soldiers,
              and inside the fort, a church named after "Nossa Senhora de
              Guadalupe". The Fort of Triquillimale was dismantled and rebuilt
              by the Dutch in 1665, renamed Fort Fredrick.

            <h3>Arugam Beach</h3>
            <p>
              Arugam Bay known locally as "Arugam Kudah", is situated on the
              Indian Ocean in the dry zone of Sri Lanka's southeast coast, and a
              historic settlement of the ancient Batticaloa Territory
              (Mattakallappu Desam). The bay is located 117 kilometres (73 mi)
              south of Batticaloa, 320 kilometres (200 mi) due east of Colombo,
              and approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the market town
              of Pottuvil. The main settlement in the area, known locally as
              Ullae, is predominantly Muslim, however there is a significant Sri
              Lankan Tamil and Sinhala population to the south of the village,
              as well as a number of international expatriates, largely from
              Europe and Australia. While traditionally fishing has dominated
              the local economy, tourism has grown rapidly in the area in recent
              years. Arugam Kudah's literal Tamil translation is "Bay of Cynodon
              dactylon". Tourism in Arugam Bay is dominated by surf tourism,
              thanks to several quality breaks in the area, however tourists are
              also attracted by the local beaches, lagoons, historic temples,
              and the nearby Kumana National Park

            <h3>Batticaloa Light House</h3>
            <p>
              Batticaloa Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Sri Lanka, situated near
              the estuary in Palameenmadu. It was built in 1913 and is 28 meters
              high.
            </p>
            <p>
              Batticaloa's lighthouse is around 5 km from Batticaloa city, on
              Bar Road. You can access to it by taking Lake Road (also called
              Munich Vittoria Friendship Road) near Kallady Bridge and
              proceeding along Sinna Uppodai Lagoon for around 4 km. It is a
              very nice area for cycling or walking.

            <h3>Nilaveli Beach</h3>
            <p>
              Nilaveli is a coastal resort town and suburb of the Trincomalee
              District, Sri Lanka located 16 km northwest of the city of
              Trincomalee. A historically popular Tamil village and tourist
              destination of the district alongside the nearby Uppuveli, the
              numbers of visitors declined following the 2004 Indian Ocean
              tsunami and Sri Lankan Civil War, but have risen again since 2010.
              Pigeon Island National Park, one of the two marine national parks
              of the region is situated 1 km off the coast of Nilaveli, its many
              species of vegetation, coral, and reef fish contributing to
              Nilaveli's rich biodiversity.
