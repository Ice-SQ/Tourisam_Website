            <h3>Ridi Viharaya</h3>
            <p>
              Ridi Viharaya is a 2nd-century BCE Theravada Buddhist temple in
              the village of Ridigama, Sri Lanka. Built during the reign of
              Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, the temple is considered as the
              place where the silver ore, which provided silver to complete
              Ruwanwelisaya; one of the largest stupa in Sri Lanka, was
              discovered. According to the chronicles Mahavamsa and Thupavamsa,
              the Ridi Viharaya complex was built in gratitude for helping him
              cherish his dream of completing Ruwanwelisaya.

            <h3>Anawilundawa Bird sanctuary</h3>
            <p>
              Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary is situated in the Puttalam district
              in the North Western province of the country; between Chilaw and
              Puttlam – to be more specific - it is situated between the coast
              and the Chilaw-Puttlam railway line. The uniqueness of
              Anawilundawa is its immediate proximity to three vastly different
              ecosystems; the coast, the mangroves and the fresh water tanks
              making it one of the six RAMSAR Wetlands in Sri Lanka. This unique
              ecological setting has made it a favourable nesting and breeding
              ground for hundreds of species of birds.
