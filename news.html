      Sri Lanka is now open for International Travellers
    </h1>
    <h3 style="color: white; text-align: left; font-size: 23px">
      Since opening for foreign arrivals in Jan 2021, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a
      steady increase in international visitors even as lockdowns persisted.
      This has allowed Sri Lanka Tourism to implement and refine its health and
      safety protocols, which have been extremely effective. The experience
      garnered since the country’s gradual opening has given authorities the
      confidence to continue accepting foreign visitors, with the sector now in
      full swing. During the downtime, the country completely revamped its
      tourism sector with revised codes of conduct, upgraded health and safety
      guidelines that meet and even exceed international standards, and numerous
      other amenities designed especially for catering to the high-end tourism
      sector.

      Sri Lanka Tourism has also worked closely with the government and
      international experts to implement new standards and international best
      practices. Including new operational guidelines with health protocols, an
      integrated system of checks and balances, as well as, resources that
      ensure more effective communication, better education, and ease of access
      to information. Sri Lanka will also continue its aggressive vaccination
      drive and has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the region. Well
      over 70% of those aged above 20 have been jabbed. Additionally, over 55%
      of the local population is fully vaccinated and 67% of the population has
      had at least one dose.

      The island, in all its tropical splendor, offers visitors an endless
      variety of memorable experiences and exotic escapades. From some of the
      world’s most beautiful beaches to misty mountains, tropical rainforest,
      and windswept plains, the island provides the sort of diversity you won't
      find anywhere else. In fact, it is unlikely there exists another place in
      the world with so much variety contained within such an accessible
      distance. Enjoy, for instance, the highest density of waterfalls in the
      world, with 350 waterfalls and 103 rivers. Over one-third of the entire
      country is covered by forest.

    <h3 style="color: white; text-align: left; font-size: 23px">
      Apart from the abundance of pristine natural beauty the island also offers
      a unique cultural experience with arts, crafts, and cuisine that speaks to
      Sri Lanka's eclectic past and diverse demographic. According to the 2021
      Readers’ Choice Awards, Sri Lanka ranks among ‘The Best Countries to
      Travel to’, voted for by Condé Nast Traveler’s readers. Other
      international coverage includes endorsements by CNN Travel, BBC, The
      Guardian, The Times, Lonely Planet, Vogue, The Telegraph, National
      Geographic, and Washington Post. It is easy to see why, with a list of
      highlights that is inexhaustible and includes 26 national parks, 8 UNESCO
      world heritage sites, and countless remnants from the days of colonial
      occupation. Journeying about the island is also quick, convenient, and
      cost-effective. With a wide range of transportation options available.
      Traffic is non-existent outside the major city centers and can be easily
      avoided. The recently constructed highway system also gives visitors easy
      access to key cities. With Colombo being just an hour away from the
      airport, Galle taking just over two hours, the east coast is about six
      hours away and Kandy takes under four hours. Though, it has been noted
      that taking the scenic route often makes the journey feel much shorter.

      Sri Lankan Ayurveda medicine continues to garner interest from around the
      world, as more people become aware of the potent healing power inherent to
      herbs, spices, medicinal plants, and other natural alternatives. Ayurveda
      is strictly regulated by the government, with practitioners requiring
      special training and certification. The tradition is based on
      centuries-old indigenous knowledge and provides a holistic alternative to
      allopathic medicine. For visitors looking for short stays or transit, the
      island has several non-stop direct flights. There is also the benefit of
      smaller crowds, lower transit times, and expedited processes, all of which
      enable a safer and happier journey.

    <h3 style="color: white; text-align: left; font-size: 23px">
      With the island being an all-year destination, special preparations are
      being made for the upcoming winter arrivals from Europe. With many direct
      flights now operating to Sri Lanka, German visitors will no doubt relish
      the chance to experience this tropical wonderland, with the opportunity to
      be among the first to arrive after the island's reopening. After all,
      visitors get to have paradise all to themselves and experience the island
      like few have before.
