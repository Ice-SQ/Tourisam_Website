            <h3>Rawana Falls</h3>
            <p>
              This waterfall measures approximately 25 m (82 ft) in height and
              cascades from an oval-shaped concave rock outcrop. During the
              local wet season, the waterfall turns into what is said to
              resemble an areca flower with withering petals. But this is not
              the case in the dry season, where the flow of water reduces
              dramatically. The falls form part of the Ravana Ella Wildlife
              Sanctuary, and is located 6 km (3.7 mi) away from the local
              railway station at Ella.

            <h3>Nine Arches Bridge</h3>
            <p>
              The Nine Arch Bridge also called the Bridge in the Sky, is a
              viaduct bridge in Sri Lanka. It is one of the best examples of
              colonial-era railway construction in the country. The construction
              of the bridge is generally attributed to a local Ceylonese
              builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers.
              The chief designer and project manager of the 'upcountry railway
              line of Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished
              Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was
              Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway Construction Department of
              Ceylon Government Railway. The 1923 report titled "Construction of
              a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon" published by the Engineering
              Association of Ceylon has details of all the records including the
              plans and drawings

            <h3>Diyaluma Falls</h3>
            <p>
              Diyaluma Falls is 220 m (720 ft) high and the second highest
              waterfall in Sri Lanka and 361st highest waterfall in the world.
              It is situated 6 km (3.7 mi) away from Koslanda in Badulla
              District on Colombo-Badulla highway. The Falls are formed by
              Punagala Oya, a tributary of Kuda Oya which in turn, is a
              tributary of Kirindi Oya.

            <h3>Bambarakanda Falls</h3>
            <p>
              Bambarakanda Falls is the tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka. With a
              height of 263 m (863 ft), it ranks as the 461st highest waterfall
              in the world. Situated in Kalupahana in the Badulla District, this

              formed by Kuda Oya, which is a tributary of the Walawe River. The
