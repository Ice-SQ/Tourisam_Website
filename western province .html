            <h3>Gangaramaya Temple</h3>
            <p>
              Gangaramaya Temple is one of the most important temples in
              Colombo, Sri Lanka, being a mix of modern architecture and
              cultural essence. Located on the Beira Lake, it was completed in
              the late 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              The temple's architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri
              Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese architecture. This Buddhist
              temple includes several imposing buildings and is situated not far
              from the placid waters of Beira Lake on a plot of land that was
              originally a small hermitage on a piece of marshy land. It has the
              main features of a Vihara (temple), the Cetiya (Pagada) the
              Bodhitree, the Vihara Mandiraya, the Seema malaka (assembly hall
              for monks) and the Relic Chamber. In addition, a museum, a
              library, a residential hall, a three storeyed Pirivena,
              educational halls and an alms hall are also on the premises.

            <h3>Galle Face</h3>
            <p>
              Galle Face is a 5 ha (12 acres) ocean-side urban park, which
              stretches for 500 m (1,600 ft) along the coast, in the heart of
              Colombo, the financial and business capital of Sri Lanka. The
              promenade was initially laid out in 1859 by Governor Sir Henry
              George Ward, although the original Galle Face Green extended over
              a much larger area than is seen today. The Galle Face Green was
              initially used for horse racing and as a golf course, but was also
              used for cricket, polo, football, tennis and rugby.
