            <h3>Temple of the tooth</h3>
            <p>
              is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the
              royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses
              the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the
              relic has played an important role in local politics because it is
              believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the
              country. The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The
              temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the
              temple and the relic.

            <h3>Sigiriya</h3>
            <p>
              Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress located in the
              northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central
              Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological
              significance that is dominated by a massive column of rock around
              180 metres (590 ft) high. According to the ancient Sri Lankan
              chronicle the Culavamsa, this area was a large forest, then after
              storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King
              Kashyapa (477 – 495 AD) for his new capital. He built his palace
              on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful
              frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this
              rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name
              of this place is derived from this structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion
              Rock .
