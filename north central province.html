            <h3>Ruwanweli Maha Seya</h3>
            <p>
              The Ruwanweli Maha Seya, also known as the Mahathupa (the Great
              Thupa) is a stupa (a hemispherical structure containing relics) in
              Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Two quarts or one Dona of the Buddha's
              relics are enshrined in the stupa, making it the largest
              collection of his relics anywhere. It was built by Sinhalese King
              Dutugemunu in c. 140 B.C., who became king of Sri Lanka after a
              war in which the Chola King Elāra (Ellalan) was defeated. It is
              also known as Swarnamali Seya, Svaṇṇamāli Mahaceti (in Pali) and
              Rathnamali Seya.

            <h3>Polonnaruwa Ruins</h3>
            <p>
              Poḷonnaruwa is the main town of Polonnaruwa District in North
              Central Province, Sri Lanka. Kaduruwela area is the Polonnaruwa
              New Town and the other part of Polonnaruwa remains as the royal
              ancient city of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. This is one of the
              "Solosmasthana" (the 16 places of veneration) and the
              "Atamasthana" (the 8 places of veneration). The stupa is one of
              the world's tallest ancient monuments, standing at 103 m (338 ft)
              and with a circumference of 290 m (951 ft). The original stupa had
              been about 55 m (180 ft) in height and was renovated by many
              kings. The Kaunghmudaw Pagoda in Sagaing, Myanmar is modelled
              after this stupa The Mahavamsa contains a detailed account on the
              construction and the opening ceremony of the stupa.

            <h3>minneriya National park</h3>
            <p>
              Minneriya National Park is a national park in North Central
              Province of Sri Lanka. The area was designated as a national park
              on 12 August 1997, having been originally declared as a wildlife
              sanctuary in 1938. The reason for declaring the area as protected
              is to protect the catchment of Minneriya tank and the wildlife of
              the surrounding area. The tank is of historical importance, having
              been built by King Mahasen in third century AD. The park is a dry
              season feeding ground for the elephant population dwelling in
              forests of Matale, Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee districts. The
              park earned revenue of Rs. 10.7 million in the six months ending
              in August 2009. Along with Kaudulla and Girithale, Minneriya forms
              one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of Sri Lanka. The park
              is situated 182 kilometres (113 mi) from Colombo.

            <h3>Mihintale</h3>
            <p>
              Mihintale is a mountain peak near Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. It is
              believed by Sri Lankans to be the site of a meeting between the
              Buddhist monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa which inaugurated
              the presence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. It is now a pilgrimage
              site, and the site of several religious monuments and abandoned
              structures.
