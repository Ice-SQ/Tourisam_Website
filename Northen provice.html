            <h3>Fort Jaffna</h3>
            <p>
              Jaffna Fort is a fort built by the Portuguese at Jaffna, Sri Lanka
              in 1618 under Phillippe de Oliveira following the Portuguese
              invasion of Jaffna. The fort is located near the coastal village
              of Gurunagar. Due to numerous miracles attributed to the statue of
              Virgin Mary in the church nearby, the fort was named as Fortress
              of Our Lady of Miracles of Jafanapatão. It was captured by the
              Dutch under Rijcklof van Goens in 1658 who expanded it. In 1795,
              it was taken over by the British, and remained under the control
              of a British garrison till 1948.

            <h3>Nagadeepa Rajamaha Viharaya</h3>
            <p>
              Nagadeepa Rajamaha Viharaya is an ancient Buddhist temple situated
              in Jaffna district of Northern Province, Sri Lanka. It is among
              the country's sixteen holiest Buddhist shrines (Solosmasthana).[1]
              According to contemporary history, the Gautama Buddha visited the
              site after five years of attaining Enlightenment to settle the
              dispute between two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara.
              Ancient history according to the Mahavamsa chronicles and the
              Tamil Buddhist epic Manimekalai mentions a gem-studded throne and
              a stone with the Buddha’s footprint at the island Nainativu, (also
              known as Nagadeepa) which pilgrims from India visited.
