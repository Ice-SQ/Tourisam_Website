            <p>
              World's End is located within the Horton Plains National Park in
              Nuwara Eliya District, Sri Lanka. It is a sheer cliff, with a drop
              of about 4,000 feet (1,200 m). It is one of the most visited parts
              of the Park, and a key tourist attraction in the Nuwara Eliya
              District and the country at large. 1 km away from the main cliff
              is a smaller cliff with a 1,000 feet (300 m) drop, colloquially
              known as Mini World's End. The Indian Ocean, 81 km to the south,
              can be observed on clear days.
